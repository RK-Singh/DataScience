# Hypothesis testing

**Statistical hypothesis testing** is defined as:<br>
**Assessing evidence provided by the data in favor of or against some claim about the population.**

**Hypothesis testing step 1: Stating the claims:**

The **null hypothesis** (denoted by "<b>H<sub>0<sub> </b>") suggests nothing special is going on; no change in the status quo.

The **alternate hypothesis** (denoted by "<b>H<sub>a<sub> </b>") disagrees with null hypothesis. It usually represents what we want to check or what we suspect is really going on.

**Hypothesis testing step 2: Choosing a sample and collecting data:**

Collect data, summarize it with sample proportion, sample mean and the sample standard deviation. Use these sample statistic to summarize a test statistic.

**Hypothesis testing step 3: Assessing the evidence:**

calculate probability of observing the data when H<sub>0</sub> is true. If this probability is very small, reject H<sub>0</sub>.

**Hypothesis testing step 4: Making concludion:**

The cut-off to reject H<sub>0</sub> ($\alpha$) is called **significance level of the test**. Commonly, $\alpha = 0.05$ or 5%.


 -  if the p-value < $\alpha$ (usually 0.05), then the data we got is considered to be "rare (or surprising) enough" when H<sub>0</sub> is true, and we say that the data provide significant evidence against H<sub>0</sub>, so we reject H<sub>0</sub> and accept H<sub>a</sub>.
 -  if the p-value > $\alpha$ (usually 0.05), then our data are not considered to be "surprising enough" when Ho is true, and we say that our data do not provide enough evidence to reject H<sub>0</sub> (or, equivalently, that the data do not provide enough evidence to accept H<sub>a</sub>).
